# cooperative-tower-building


Game Description: Synchronicity Tower Builder
Genre: Cooperative Coordination Game
Players: 2 (1 Human + 1 AI Partner)
Age: 10+
Playtime: Ends when target floors built (e.g., 15 floors, ~5-10 min)
Components: Circular board, 3 cups, 2 shooter tokens, floor tokens, example cards


Overview
In Synchronicity Tower Builder, a human and AI partner simultaneously shoot at three cups in a circle to build a tower with a set number of floors (e.g., 15). The human shoots a cup while rotating clockwise; the AI targets the next clockwise cup. Successful shots add a floor. The AI learns from human examples to sync rotations, helping reach the goal. The game ends when the target floors are built. Simple, cooperative, and accessible, it promotes strategic harmony.
Mechanics

Objective: Build target floors (e.g., 15) via accepted shots.
Action: Both rotate (180°) and shoot in real-time pulses. Human shoots clockwise; AI follows with next clockwise cup.
Accepted Shot: Human’s clockwise shot + AI’s next clockwise shot adds 1 floor. Mismatches add nothing.
AI Learning: Human’s example sequences train AI to adjust rotation for success.
End: Game stops when target floors are built; efficiency (fewer pulses) wins.
